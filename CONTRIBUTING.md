## Local development

- The complete test suite depends on having at least the following installed
  (possibly not a complete list)
  - git (Version 2.24.0 or above is required )
  - python3.10.x (Required by a test which checks different python versions)
  - tox (or venv)
  - poetry, pip, pipeenv, virtualenv, or similar

### Setting up an environment

The project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage its dependencies. Please install it using the following command :

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Then, please install the dependencies using the following command :

```bash
poetry install
```

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies using the following command :

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r .utils/requirements-dev.txt
```
### Running a specific test

Running a specific test with the environment activated is as easy as:
`pytest tests -k test_the_name_of_your_test`

### Running all the tests

With the environment activated you can run all of the tests
using:
`pytest tests`
